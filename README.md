# Structural Model Database

This is a repository of .JSON files representing the topology and section properties of structural model geometries used throughout my PhD dissertation:

*Geometric interpretations of structural demand for the analysis and reduction of design complexity*

More structural examples will be added as my research progresses.


# `biosphere`
A structural model of the 1967 US Pavilion (AKA the Biosphere), Buckminster Fuller + hoji Sadao. 
Used in dissertation.
Modelled as a truss.

# `supersam`
A structural model of Waclaw Zalewski's Supersam roof structure with a conventional Pratt truss alternative.
Used in dissertation.
Modelled as trusses.

# `nervi`
An approximated structural model of the Palazzetto dello Sport by Pier Luigi Nervi.
The topology was generated by student Xinyang (Alan) Chen for his class project in 1.056 Introduction to Structural Design (Spring 2025).
Modelled as a frame with approximate section properties.
